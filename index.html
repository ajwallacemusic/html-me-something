                <h2>Foundations</h2>
                <p>Music has been a part of my life since I can remember. Specifically, I remember listening to my Dad play songs on his guitar
                    and later singing Beatles and Eagles songs along with him. I remember listening to Paul Simon on the stereo in the living room with my mom.
                    German nursery rhymes from my Grandma, Country Gospel songs from my Grandpa. I think it's no surprise that my own personal musical style has
                    ended up in the ecclectic folk rock branch of Americana, with strong Country Western, 60's Phschedelic Pop, and Southern/Classic Rock influences.</p>
                <p>Fifth grade introduced me to formal music instruction, and the saxophone. Christmas of sixth grade landed me my first guitar (apart from my Dad's acoustic
                     that I was attempting to play nonstop.) Without formal guitar lessons, I applied the music theory I was learning in school to the guitar. Eventually I
                    discovered tabs and got a couple of self-guided practice books for guitar. Next thing you know, I'm learning how to play Metal solos and now I'm the lead
                guitarist of your typical early 2000's alt rock high school band (so cool.)</p>
                <p>Ah, but the glory was not long lived. Just as 99% of high school rock bands meet their dramatic end, so too did War-Town. And looking back, I'm not upset
                    about it. Although I can look back and laugh now, there was some serious emotional pain involved in the band breakup, combined with quintessential high
                school romances gone amuck. My interest in audio production and recording grew quite a bit while in the band, thanks to some lucky connections with a local 
            church with a small recording studio. That interest, combined with a scholarship, landed me at Webster University, in the Audio Production program.</p>
